The AI career recommendation system is a python-based application that suggests suitable 
career paths based on a user's skills, interests and preferences.
Featuring a simple tkinter interface, it analyzes responses and provides clear, personalized recommendations.
It can save time and reduce confusion by narrowing down options from the vast job market to only those that are most relevant.
